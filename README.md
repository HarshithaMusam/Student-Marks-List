# Student-Marks-List
This project involves creating an HTML form for collecting student marks and using PHP to manage the database connection and data storage. The HTML form allows users to input student marks, which are then processed by PHP and securely stored in a database, facilitating efficient data management and retrieval.

We maintain three files for managing student marks data:

HTML Student Marks Form: Collects student marks information via an HTML form.
Database Connection (PHP): Connects to the database to facilitate data interaction.
Data Storage (PHP): Handles the insertion of student marks into the database.
